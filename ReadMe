Hello, Andres Cuenca reporting in!

Thank you for taking the time to read this document. This github project covers on how to learn to read, document, and analyze a control system of a robot. For this particular example, I applied a SCARA (Selective compliance assembly robotic arm) robot. This SCARA robot model is a RRPR robot, known as revolute, revolute, prismatic, revolute which motion relative to z-axis.

# For the control system of the robot, the project is broken down by milestone:

    Set up the forward kinematics of the robot.
    Set up the inverse kinematics of the robot.
    Generate the inverse dynamics of the robot.
    Derive the electro-mechanical equations to create the plant system of the robot.
    Use MATLAB to analyze PID and plant control system.
    Create an Arduino code to read the direction and speed of a DC Motor.
    Create a PID Arduino code to control the position of the DC motor shaft.
    Generate a simulation program to monitor the torque of DC motor relative to angular speed and position.
    Make conclusion of the control system of the robot.

# Requirements for project

    MATLAB (python can work)
    Arduino Microcontroller
    DC Motor integrated with a quadrature encoder
    Arduino IDE
    Excel- used for storing data
    SolidWorks - used for capturing inertia, mass and center of mass of the robotic model

# Required Background

    Intermediate programming
    Linear Alegbra
    Strong knowledge in dynamic and kinematics physics
    Basic background in electronics and hardware
    Some exposure to CAD modeling design

Last and most importantly, eager to learn and have fun!!
